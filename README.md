Customer Segmentation By ML
#customer segmentation for mall through machine learning in python 
#Data Collection:
Typical data might include age, gender, income, purchase frequency, average transaction value, and preferred product categories
#Data Preprocessing:
Clean the data by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting inconsistencies.
#Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Visualize the data to understand distributions, relationships, and patterns.
#Feature Selection:
Select relevant features that will be used for segmentation. This could involve dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA (Principal Component Analysis) to reduce the feature space while retaining the variance.
#Clustering Algorithms:
Apply clustering algorithms such as K-means, DBSCAN, or hierarchical clustering to segment the customers.
Determine the optimal number of clusters using methods like the Elbow Method or Silhouette Analysis.
#Model Implementation:
Implement the clustering algorithm in Python, typically using libraries like scikit-learn.
#Interpret and Profile Segments:
Analyze the resulting clusters to profile each segment. This involves examining the centroid of each cluster and the distribution of features within each cluster.
Create detailed profiles for each segment to understand their characteristics and needs.
#Visualization:
Visualize the clusters using techniques like scatter plots or PCA to reduce the data to two or three dimensions for easy interpretation.
